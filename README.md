# Shirt_Colour_Detection
The "Shirt_Colour_Detection" project uses YOLO for shirt detection in images/webcam feeds. It extracts dominant colors via KMeans clustering and displays results via Streamlit. Users upload images or use live cameras to identify shirt colors with OpenCV, PIL, and PyTorch integration.
